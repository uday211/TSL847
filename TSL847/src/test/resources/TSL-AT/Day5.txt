What is FrameWork:
------------------

FrameWork:
----------
	Set of protocols | Rules |  Guidelines which need to be followed for Better out

Why FrameWork:
--------------
	To have effective/Good outcome (In Case of Our example effective seminar)


Test Automation Framework:
--------------------------
	Set of Re-usable Classes, methods(Functions) & Object repository.


Total How Many times  4:
------------------------

Object repository: 
------------------
	This is collection of all Objects Property(id, name,css, linktext,xpath)
	for Ease of Change(Ease of Maintain)

	>UserName has been used  in 10 Classes
	>If UserName property changed we need to do Changed at 10 (If Object Repository 		is not used)
	>But One Place if You are using Object Repository.

Advantage of Framework:
-----------------------
	1.Ease of Change(Easy to Maintain)
	2.Code Re-usability is there(Need to write once & Many time can be used)
	3.Easy of trace.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Types of Framework:
	-------------------
	1.User-Defined Framework:
		1.Data-Driven Framework.	
		2.Keyword Driven Framework
		3.Hybrid(Data + Keyword) 

	2.Pre-defined Framework:
		1.Junit
		2.TestNG
		3.Cucumber
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	What is TestNG:(NG means next Generation)
	---------------
	>It is Unit Testing Framework used by developer at time of Development of 	Modules|Unit
	
	Why:
	----
	>WebDriver does not have in-build capacity to generate reports, Hence there is 		need of Report generator tool.
	>Better Management of Tests


	Why TestNG(Why not Junit)
	>Meaningful annotations name
	>Making test suite is easy as compare to Junit
	>Parallel Testing is possible in Testng
	>HTML reports also generated( not generated in Junit).

	How to do Installations of TestNG:
 	1.Go inside Help> MarketPlace
	2.Enter TestNG in Find Field & Click on Go.	
	3.

Group of Test Cases > Test Suite

Why Test Suited : 
----------------
To run test scripts in Single attempt.





Annotation Execution Flow:
-------------------------
In Before Suite
In Before Test
In Before Class
In before Method
In Test 1
In after Method
In before Method
In Test 2
In after Method
In before Method
In Test 3
