Suppose We have 

For Automation Testing 

Test Case > convert into language of Tool > Test Script

1000 TC: All Test cases will not be taken for Automation Testing.
-------- 



Which Test Cases Should be Automated ?
-------------------------------------
1.Repetable & Reusable
	1.Smoke Testing(BVT|BAT|Confidence Test)
	2.Regression Testing
	3.Compatibility Testing(Multi-Platform testing)
	4.Data-Driven Testing | Parametrization
		Repeating same steps(Actions) with different set of Data.
			
2.Test Cases Which is not possible to do manually
	i.e Performance Testing

--------------------------------------------------------

Selenium :
----------
1.It is Functional Testing tool.
2.Best Suited for Regression Testing
3.It is Designed for Web Application Testing.
4.Selenium Supports multiple platform(Windows, linux, MAc etc.)
5.Selenium Supports multiple Browser(Chrome, Firefox, Opera etc.)
6.Selenium Supports Multiple OOPs languages as well
	Java, C#, Ruby, Python etc.
7.Free 
8.Open Source

-------------------------------------------------------------

Selenium Suite:
--------------
1.Selenium IDE
	>It is available as Firefox & Chrome plug-in.
	>Having Capacity of Record(Capture) & Playback
	>Best tool to start with automation Testing since it is 
	>easy to use
	>Test Designing + Test Execution Tool.
	
	DisAdvantage:
	1.does not support oops programming languages hence code 		reusablity is not possible.
	2.Does not all supports browser

2.Selenium RC | Selenium 1.0
	1.First Tool is Selenium Suite which started supporting 		multiple OOPS Languages(Java,C#,Ruby, Python etc.)
	2.First Tool is Selenium Suite which started supporting
	Multiple Browser(i.e Chrome, Firefox, Opera etc.)
	3.Test Designing + Test Execution Tool.
	4.Single Machine + Multiple Browser
	DisAdvantage"
	1.RC Server is acting as middle Man Which is Adding Delay
	2.RC Server need to be Started Everytime Manually Every 		Time

3.Selenium WebDriver (Selenium 2.0 | Selenium 3.0 ) > Selenium 4.0
	1.Supports Multiple programming languages
	2.Supports multiple Browser
	3.Test Designing + Test Execution Tool.
	4.Single Machine + Multiple Browser

	What Makes WebDriver Different:
	1.It does not need any server to be started & which is 			adding delay.
	2.Fast as Compare to Selenium RC
	
4.Selenium Grid
	1.Hub(Master) and Node(Slave) Structure is used
	2.Here, Multiple Systems are Used 
	3.Used for Parallel Testing with various (Browser & OS 	combination).
	4.With this Test Execution time is minimized.
	5.Multiple Machine + Multiple Browser.

History :
---------
1.In 2004, Jason Huggins Engineer at thoughtwork lab was performing Regression Testing.
2.Jason understood that regression testing is repitative due to this productivity is so good.
3.He has written one JavaScript having capacity of Record & Playback & Named as JavaScriptTestRunner > Selnium Core

In 2004, QTP was Major tool in Market
	
----------------------------------------------------------------

Selenium IDE:
-------------



--------------------------------------------------------------
Selenium WebDriver:
-------------------

Environment Needed for WebDriver:
1.JDK (Minimum 1.8 > )
2.Editor(Notepad, Notepad++, Eclipse, Netbean etc.)
3.Selenium Libraries
	Selenium Java Libraries
	Selenium Jars
4.Browser Executable Driver
	Chrome > ChromeDriver
	Firefox> geckodriver



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Element Locators:
-----------------
Properties which helps selenium to identify Web Objects | WebElements.




1.id
2.name
3.linktext
4.css
5.Xpath

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Synchronization:
-----------------
	Matching Speed between two things(Software)
	1.AUT|SUT > OrangeHRM
	2.Selenium

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CSS: Cascading Style sheet formal used for making website presentable.

CSS Selector:
	1.CSS with ID
		tagname#id

	2.CSS with name/type/value or any other Property
		tagname[attribute='value of Attributes']

	3.CSS with className
